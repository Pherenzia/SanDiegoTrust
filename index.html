                    <h3>Finding Your Home</h3>
                    <p>With rising rents and stricter rental conditions, it has become challenging for Japanese residents to find housing on their own in San Diego. We'll support you every step of the way, using our trusted local network to help you find the perfect homestay or room rental that fits your needs.</p>

                    <h3>Community College</h3>
                    <p>Some community colleges accept English proficiency scores such as Eiken or Duolingo, making admission easier compared to four-year universities. Tuition is also significantly more affordable. One of the main advantages is that students can improve their English skills while taking courses in their field of interest. After completing two years of study, it's possible to transfer to a four-year university, such as the University of California or California State University. From school selection and application procedures to local support after arrival, we provide comprehensive assistance every step of the way.</p>

Based on your goals and preferences, we'll recommend the school that best fits your needs and support you throughout the entire enrollment process.</p>

                    <p>If you plan to study in the U.S. for more than 90 days, you'll need to obtain an F-1 student visa. We handle all the complicated steps for you—from receiving your school's admission document (Form I-20) and paying the SEVIS fee, to completing the DS-160 visa application form and scheduling your embassy interview. Our goal is to make sure even first-time applicants can prepare for studying abroad with confidence, through careful and reliable support every step of the way.</p>

We'll help you choose the best camp based on your child's age and interests, and provide full support from registration to participation.

                    <h2>Our Story</h2>
                    <p>It all began when I watched the movie Top Gun as a student. The bright California skies, the open beaches, and the vibrant people on screen captured my heart and eventually led me to San Diego.</p>
                    <p>I've lived in the United States for 26 years, and in San Diego for 20 of those. With its mild weather all year round, friendly people, and easy access to Japanese food and restaurants, San Diego is truly a wonderful and comfortable place to live.</p>
                    <p>I started San Diego Trust with a wish to share the beauty of this amazing city with more people and to help those who come here live with peace of mind.</p>
                    <p>Our mission is to provide thoughtful, reliable support so you can always feel at ease. Just like being with family.</p>

I couldn't have accessed this opportunity in Japan, so it was incredibly helpful. The host family they introduced was kind and warm, and all my pre-departure worries quickly disappeared. I had heard that host families can be hit or miss, but ours was definitely a perfect match! Thanks to their support, I had a fulfilling and memorable stay. Thank you so much."</p>

My stay in San Diego was such a wonderful experience, but one month was not enough. I wish I could have stayed longer.

At first, we tried working with a real estate agency in San Diego, but the fees were extremely high, which was surprising. We also tried searching on websites ourselves, but we couldn't find any properties that met our needs, and emails often went unanswered. That's when we reached out to San Diego Trust. They helped us find an apartment that perfectly matched our budget and requirements at a reasonable price. Even after the move, they supported us by delivering household essentials and providing various other assistance. We are truly grateful for all their help. Our entire family received amazing support, and we wholeheartedly recommend their services!"</p>
